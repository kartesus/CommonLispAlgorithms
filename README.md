## Chap 4 - Data Structures

> Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.Even the simplest procedural logic is hard for humans to
> verify, but quite complex data structures are fairly easy to model and reason about. To see this, compare the expressiveness and
> explanatory power of a diagram of (say) a fifty-node pointer tree with a flowchart of a fifty-line program. Or, compare
> an array initializer expressing a conversion table with an equivalent switch statement. The difference in transparency and clarity
> is dramatic.Data is more tractable than program logic. It follows that where you see a choice between complexity in data structures
> and complexity in code, choose the former. More: in evolving a design, you should actively seek ways to shift complexity from code to
> data
